    <div class='row'><p>Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock is a modification of the ages old game of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%E2%80%93paper%E2%80%93scissors' rel='external' title="Wiki Article about rock paper scissors">rochambeau</a>.  It adds two additional moves to the regular rock-paper-scissors, and each hand can defeat and is defeated by two other hands.</p>
    <p><a href="http://info.mitre.org/orgs/J85D" title="J85D Org Page" rel="external">J85D</a> is hosting this site as a friendly competition site.  Players can either create a web service that will play the game based on analyzing the opponent's attack pattern, or they can choose to play as a human against those bots to see which bot is best at predicting the human's next move.</p></div>

    <h5 class="row">As a Human Player</h5>
    <div class="row">
      <p>Participating as a human player is pretty simple.  Just go to the <a href='#' route-href="route: bots">Bots</a> page and select a bot to battle.  Each match is 'best 3 of 5' hands, so we would appreciate it if you can stay in the game for 3 hands per match, though they will go quickly in most cases.</p>
    </div>
    <h5 class="row">As a Bot Commander (Team)</h5>
    <div class="row">
      <p>Bots are managed by teams, so to get started <a href="" route-href="route: teams">create or join a team</a>.  Once on a team, you can see a list of bots owned by the team and create a new one.</p>
      <h6>What's a bot?</h6>
      <p>An RPSLS Bot is a RESTful service, hosted by the team owning it somewhere. It must expose at least one URL that will accept a POST request with a JSON body about a match and respond in a timely fashion with a string of the next move it wants to make (e.g. "rock", "spock", etc).  To configure a Bot, you need at least a name and a URL to it, and optionally a secret key, a description and a URL to an image that will be used as an icon.</p>
      <p>If a secret key is provided, the Match will be sent to the Bot as a <a href="https://jwt.io/introduction/" rel="external" title="JSON Web Token RFC website">JWT</a> encrypted with the secret key.</p>
      <h6>What's a Match?</h6>
      <p>When two players (bot and human) engage in a Match, each will get information about what moves have been made so far, and will need to respond with their next move.  This will continue until one player wins at least 3 hands.  The schema for a Match is as follows:</p>
      <pre><code>{
  opponent: String /* UUID */,
  history: JSON Array of Hand ([{hand}, {hand},...],
  started: Date,
  lastMove: Date /* Will be null when the match starts */
}</code></pre>
      <p>And the schema for a Hand is as follows:</p>
      <pre><code>{
  player1: {
    id: String /* UUID */
    move: String /* Enum of { rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock, invalid } */
  },
  player2: {
    id: String /* UUID */
    move: String /* Enum of { rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock, invalid } */
  },
  result: {
    win: String, /* equivalent to the move that was made that won, e.g. "rock" */
    text: String, /* display text such as "Lizard poisons Spock" */
    winner: String /* player1 or player2 */
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>Sample response from a Bot:</p>
<pre><code>lizard
</code></pre>
